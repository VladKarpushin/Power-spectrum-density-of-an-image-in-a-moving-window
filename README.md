Power spectrum density of an image in a moving window
==========================

Goal
----

In this tutorial you will learn:

-   how to investigate an image by Power spectrum density (PSD) in a moving window

Theory
------


Result
------
PSD is the Power spectrum density.
ACF is the Autocorrelation Function.
ROI is the Region of interest.
Below figures show ROI of an image, PSD, log(PSD) and ACF. You can move ROI and see how PSD and ACF varies.

The figure below shows the result of anisotropic ROI
